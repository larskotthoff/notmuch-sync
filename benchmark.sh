echo "4. Dependencies:"
echo "Python version requires:"
echo "  - Python 3.x runtime"
echo "  - notmuch2 Python library"
echo "  - asyncio (built-in)"

echo "Go version requires:"
echo "  - No runtime dependencies"
echo "  - Single static binary"

echo "5. Deployment advantages of Go version:"
echo "  ✓ Single binary deployment"
echo "  ✓ No dependency management"
echo "  ✓ Faster startup time"
echo "  ✓ Lower memory usage"
echo "  ✓ Better cross-platform support"
echo "  ✓ Easier to distribute"
